                    Your options here include your network, job fairs, and job boards. 
                    It’s important to keep an open mind here and explore any opportunities that come your way.
                    Many companies only keep junior developers that “graduated” from an internship, 
                    so an internship is definitely a viable first option that comes with less pressure than signing up 
                    as a full-fledged developer from the get-go. <br>
                    Your first interview probably won’t be the one that lands the job. 
                    Getting a job in IT isn’t as easy as people like to make it out to be, 
                    even with the right background and preparation. If you’re certain about this path, 
                    keep at it and try to learn from any rejections along the way. Also, remember the
                    “engineer” part of the title: over the long run, you should make sure you can look 
                    at a problem at a conceptual level first, solve it architecturally, and only then implement the code. 
                    This is easier said than done, but having an engineer’s mindset makes a huge difference in the long run.
