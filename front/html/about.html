                           As Software engineer at MeshPower I conceptualize, develop, test and deploy
                           Meshpower's new solutions. So far I built MeshPower’s circuit board fault 
                           recording system from scratch and MeshPower Automatic Lighting dashboard front end.
                           I integrated Netlify Content Management into Meshpower website and with the CEO 
                           we changed Meshpower payment gateway which was for Havanao to accomodate MTN and Airtel
                           mobile money

                        <p>
                           Mostly used languages are python and its frameworks Django and Flask, then react at the frontEnd. 
                           In deployment I mostly use nginx, gunicorn and docker

                       Joining Andela is one of the best choice I ever met that I will never regret. 
                       At first, it didn't feel like a place for me after graduating from CMU. But, Yes
                       I did need the Andela training since I joined CMU without any coding experience. 
                       CMU got me into programming world, fed me with programming principles, connected me 
                       with talented people and strengthened my confidence. Then, Andela took my hand and 
                       help me to start walking independently 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From Andela I learnt JavaScript, css and html. This website is the first product From
                        skills I acquired from Andela and I went on to learn react and I did some personal 
                        projects that are found in my portofilio
